Sampling every single trend and experimenting with every new item on the market might be exhausting. Nevertheless, external influences force us to undergo style experimentation phases, where we repeatedly lose ourselves while trying on different looks and aesthetics. These phases usually lead to inconsistency in our wardrobe and make it challenging to define a consistent, unique style.<br\/><\/p><p><br\/><\/p><p>Let us introduce the cutest soul, Sarah @etcbysarah! Many people engage with Sarah, who has been shopping with us and styling our clothes for a long time, and follow her because of her personality, interests, values, and personal style. She has been a source of inspiration for so many people over the years, and our customers are constantly sending us links and screenshots to help them adopt her unique style.  <br\/><\/p><p><br\/><\/p><p>With this in mind, we collaborated with Sarah to help people save time and effort while adopting their personal style. Sarah has curated her fall collection that includes pieces she calls 'most me,' so if your personal choices align, you are welcome to explore the 'What Sarah Wears' Collection. Sarah put significant input into this, and you should follow her account as she will show how she styles every single one during the season. <\/p>",
